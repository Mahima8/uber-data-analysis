# Uber Trip Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber trip data to understand travel patterns, fare distribution, trip distance behavior, surge pricing impact, and vehicle usage. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from ride data using Python.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains Uber trip records with the following features:
- Trip ID  
- Pickup Time  
- Drop Off Time  
- Passenger Count  
- Trip Distance  
- Pickup Location ID  
- Drop-off Location ID  
- Fare Amount  
- Surge Fee  
- Vehicle Type  
- Payment Type  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Trip count analysis  
- Fare amount distribution  
- Trip distance analysis  
- Passenger count patterns  
- Vehicle type usage  
- Payment method distribution  
- Surge fee impact on fare  

## 📊 Visualizations
- Bar charts  
- Histogram  
- Scatter plots  

## ✅ Key Insights
- Most trips are short-distance rides  
- UberX is the most frequently used vehicle type  
- Cash and Uber Pay are the most common payment modes  
- Higher surge fees generally increase fare amount
